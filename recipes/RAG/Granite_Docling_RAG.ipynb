        "Welcome to this Granite recipe, in this recipe, you'll learn to harness the power of advanced tools to build AI-powered document retrieval systems. It will guide you through:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Document Processing:** Learn to handle documents from various sources, parse and transform them into usable formats, and store them in vector databases using Docling.\n",
        "- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Understand how to connect large language models (LLMs) like Granite with external knowledge bases to enhance query responses and generate valuable insights.\n",
        "- **LangChain for Workflow Integration:** Discover how to use LangChain to streamline and orchestrate document processing and retrieval workflows, enabling seamless interaction between different components of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This recipe leverages three cutting-edge technologies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **[Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/):** An open-source toolkit for parsing and converting documents.\n",
        "2. **[Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/models/granite/):** A state-of-the-art LLM available via an [API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api) through Replicate, providing robust natural language capabilities.\n",
        "3. **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain):** A powerful framework for building applications powered by language models, designed to simplify complex workflows and integrate external tools seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this recipe, you will:\n",
        "- Gain proficiency in document processing and chunking.\n",
        "- Integrate vector databases to enhance retrieval capabilities.\n",
        "- Utilize RAG to perform efficient and accurate data retrieval for real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This recipe is designed for AI developers, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to enhance their knowledge of document management and advanced NLP techniques.\n"

The most famous model, the Bugatti Veyron, was one of the fastest and most expensive cars in the world when it was introduced. The current model, the Bugatti Chiron, continues this tradition with a quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine that produces 1500 horsepower. Bugatti cars are known for their top speed, luxury, and exclusivity.\n",

            "McLaren, on the other hand, is a British manufacturer known for its high-performance sports cars and involvement in Formula 1. McLaren cars are often lighter and more agile than their competitors, thanks to extensive use of carbon fiber in their construction. The McLaren 720S, for example, is a mid-engine sports car with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 engine that produces 710 horsepower. McLaren cars are often praised for their handling, speed, and innovative technology.\n",

It ultimately depends on your personal preferences, budget, and what you value most in a car.\n"
